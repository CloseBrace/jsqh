// There's no real difference between and "exception" and an "error" in JavaScript
// in fact, JavaScript only has the concept of errors, like this one:

try {
  throw new Error('Oh no, the barbarians have broken down the gate and are stealing our data!');
} catch (e) {
  console.log(e.message);
}

// By convention, "errors" are what the JavaScript engine gives you when you screw up
// (uncomment to make this work)

/*
const str = "You can't change this";
str = "But I want to change it!" // TypeError
*/

// And "exceptions" are errors intentionally thrown by the developer
// (uncomment to make this work)


const input = 2000 // pretend this value came from a form field, or similar
try {
  if (input > 1000) {
    throw new Error('Sorry, the value must be less than 1000');
  }
} catch (e) {
  console.log(e.message); // Sorry, the value must be less than 1000
}
