**JS Quick Hit: CloseBrace Reader Survey**

Video URL: https://youtu.be/7hSIN4a4DV0

Hello everyone. I'm trying to get a better handle on what readers of this newsletter are looking for as we move forward. I've covered a wide array of JavaScript topics already and am not a hundred percent sure where to go from here. Obviously I can expand into more complex topics, but it's hard to keep those "quick". Maybe that's fine - I haven't gotten too many objections when I've done multi-part tutorials in the past. On the other hand, open rates on the newsletter do go down when it's part three of a five part tutorial, so that's an indication that y'all prefer the shorter stuff.

Rather than guessing, I've decided to put together an extremely short survey. I've listed all of the questions below, and you can feel free to respond by just replying to this newsletter, but if you want to make your life _really_ easy, you can take the survey by just clicking the link directly below this paragraph.

# [Take the CloseBrace Survey](https://eSurv.org?s=MCLDNF_4a43de3f)

I'd really appreciate your participation, so I can figure out what the heck I'm doing with this thing, and make sure it's delivering the kind of content you're looking for! Thanks very much for reading, and I hope you'll take a couple of minutes to take the survey.

Here are those questions!

### On a scale of zero to five, how would you rate your JavaScript Knowledge?
0. I literally just started programming
1. I know a bit of JS, or I know another programming language
2. I'm comfortable with the basics of JavaScript programming
3. I understand a lot of JS and/or have at least two years of JS experience
4. I'm an advanced JS developer and/or have at least four years of JS experience
5. I have five or more years of direct working experience with JS

### What areas of JavaScript are you most interested in learning (please check at least three)?
* Functional Programming
* GraphQL
* Core JavaScript Competencies (eg: "arrow functions", "Array.filter")
* Object-Oriented Programming
* jQuery
* Database ORMs (eg: Mongoose, MySQL connectors, etc)

### Should I expand this newsletter out to cover more tutorials and resources from other people, or keep it short and just focus on the tutorial each week?
* Expand it!
* Keep it simple!

### Would you listen to a weekly 20-30 minute podcast highlighting a piece of JavaScript technology, framework, or module and explaining what it is, how it works, how other people are using it, and how it might be helpful?
* Heck yeah, that sounds awesome!
* I'd definitely check out some episodes.
* I doubt it, but I might listen to one or two.
* Definitely not my thing.

### Which of these products would you consider paying for?
* Live streams of coding work
* Individual video coaching / training
* Video workshops (1 - 3 hours)

### Do you have any other thoughts on what you'd like to see from CloseBrace in 2020 and beyond?

(no choices, totally optional, just let me know if you have any thoughts!)

That's it. That's the survey. I'd absolutely love to hear from you. Thanks again, and I'll be back next week with a normal tutorial. See you then!
